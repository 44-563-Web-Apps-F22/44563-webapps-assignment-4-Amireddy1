        LUD.  (aside).  I wish I'd married one of 'em!
        JULIA.  But, you see, I must consider my temperament. For instance, my temperament would demand some strong scenes of justifiable jealousy.
        LUD.  Oh, there's no difficulty about that.  You shall have them.
        JULIA.  With a lovely but detested rival—
        LUD.  Oh, I'll provide the rival.
        JULIA.  Whom I should stab—stab—stab!
        LUD.  Oh, I wouldn't stab her.  It's been done to death.  I should treat her with a silent and contemptuous disdain, and delicately withdraw from a position which, to one of your sensitive nature, would be absolutely untenable.  Dear me, I can see you delicately withdrawing, up centre and off!
        JULIA.  Can you?
        LUD.  Yes.  It's a fine situation—and in your hands, full of quiet pathos!
